## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

### File Size:
- Your `world_cities.json` (6.6MB) works fine on Render
- If you get size limits, use `world_cities_15000.json` instead

### Performance:
- Free tier "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- After that, normal performance

### Monitoring:
- Check logs in Render dashboard if issues occur
- Use the health check endpoint: `/api/health`

**Render.com Free Tier:**
- ✅ 750 hours/month (31 days × 24 hours = 744 hours)
- ✅ Automatic SSL
- ✅ Custom domains
- ✅ More than enough for personal use

**When you need more:**

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting:**

### Build Fails:
1. Check requirements.txt is properly formatted
2. Ensure all files are uploaded
3. Check build logs in Render

### App Won't Start:
1. Verify Procfile content: `web: gunicorn app:app`
2. Check Python version in runtime.txt
3. Review startup logs

### Can't Find Cities:
1. Ensure `world_cities.json` was uploaded
2. Check file size limits
3. Try smaller city database if needed
