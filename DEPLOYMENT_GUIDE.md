## Important Notes:

### File Size Considerations:
Your `world_cities.json` file (6.6MB) should work fine on most platforms, but if you encounter issues:
1. Consider using the smaller `world_cities_15000.json` (fewer cities but smaller file)
2. Compress the JSON file
3. Use a database instead of JSON file

### Performance Tips:
1. Enable caching
2. Optimize search algorithms
3. Use CDN for static files

### Security:
1. Never commit sensitive data
2. Use environment variables for configurations
3. Enable HTTPS (most platforms provide this automatically)
