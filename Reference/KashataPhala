ISHTA PHALA AND KASHTA PHALA

The Ishta Phala or Kashta Phala indicate the nature of
results to be had in the Dasha or Antar-Dasha of a planet.lf
the lshta (good) phala, of a planet is more than its Kashta
(bad) Phala. The planet will be more helpful in its Dasha
or Antar-Dasha. If the Kashta Phala is more than the lshta
Phala, it indicates that the ptaitet is not helpful in this period
and may give adverse results. The formulae for lshta Phala
and Kashta Phala are:

Ishta Phala = Square root of (Uchcha Bala x Chesta BaJa)
Kashta Phala = Square root of((60- Uchcha BaJa) (60- Chesta BaJa))

We have to fmd out the Uchcha Bala and Chesta Bala
for finding out the lshta Phala and Kashta Phala.
The Uchcha Bala of all the planets of the standard
horoscope have been calculated while finding out the
positional strength. The Chesta Bala of all the planets except
the two lumanaries (Sun and Moon) have been found out
in chapter 5.
Though Sun and Moon never retrograde, yet a method
has been prescribed to fmd out their Chesta Bala, which
is essential for calculating their lshta Phala and Kashta
Ph ala.
Sun's Chesta BaJa :
Add ninty degrees to the Sayana longitude of the sun
and if it is more than 180° deduct it from 360°. After that
divide by 3.


In the case of standard horoscope :
Sun's Nirayana Longitude = 146°.37
Ayanamsa = +23°.60
Sun's Sayana Longitude = 169°.97
= +90°
= 259°.97
as it is more than 180° deduct from 360°
J60°- 259°.97 = 100°.03
Chesta bala of Sun = 100.03 / 3 = 33.34

Moon :
Deduct the longitiude of Sun from that of Moon and
divide by three ifless than 180°, otherwise divide by three
after deducting it from 360°
In the case of Standard Horoscope :
Moon's Longitude = 309.50
Sun's Longitude = - 146.37
163.13
which is less than 180° so no necessity of deducting it from
360°.
Moon's Chesta Bala = 163.13 / 3= 54.38

= Paksha Bala of Benefics.

For this horoscope Moon and Mercury are the planets
which have more Ishta Phala than Kashta Phala. So they
will give good results during their Dasha and Antar-Dashas
while the others are reverse. Especially Venus and Mars
whose Kashta Phala is much more than the Ishta Phala,
will give adverse results in their Dashas and Antar-Dashas.
Though Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are also having their Kashta
Phala more than Ishta Phala but the difference is not so
wide as in other cases. The results of Dashas and Antar-
Dashas are to be judged very carefully as the stronger of
the lords ofDasha or Antar-Dasha will predominate over
the other for giving the results.
