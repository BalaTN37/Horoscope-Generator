.. (a) UchchaBala :
This strength is maximum when the planet is at its deep
exaltation point and is assigned sixty shashtiamsas. When
. it is at its debilitation point, its strength is minimum say, a
value of zero shashtiamsa. There is gradual increase from
debilitation point to exaltation point and decrease from
exaltation point to debilitation point. The distance between
exaltation point and debilitation point is 180" on either side
of the zodiac.
This implies that the Uchchabala of a planet is due
to its distance from the debilitation' point and it gains sixty
shastiamsas in 180". If x" is its distance from debilitation
.1 0
point its uchchaba1a = X0 x 60 + 180 = x/3 Shashtiall}sas
By this we deduce the formula Uchchabala is equal
to difference between the longitudes of the Planet and its
debilitation point divided by three.
