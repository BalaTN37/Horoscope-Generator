Directional strength or Digbala is the strength gained by
the planets due to the occupancy of different directions by
them in the horoscope.
Direction :- The directions in a horoscope are as
under:
The Ascendant represents the East while the
seventh house represents the west, the tenth the south
while the fourth the northern direction.
Every planet is powerful in a particular direction and
gets certain amount of strength by virtue of its being posited
in that direction.

When these planets are at Bhava Madhya at their
powerful house, they will get 60 shashtiamsa as directional
strength.
Their directional strength will be zero, when they will
be at the Bhava Madhya at their powerless point as they
will lose all directional power.
The directional strength increases uniformly from
powerless point to the Powerful point from zero to sixty
shashtiamsa and decreases uniformly from powerful point
to powerless point from sixty to zero shashtiamsa. The
difference between the longitudes of powerful and
powerless point equal to hundred and eighty degrees hence
in one degree it gains or loses
60 / 180 = 1/3 shashtiamsa.
When the diherence oflongitudes of a planet from that of
its powerless point is divided by three it gives the directional
strength of the planet. The difference between the longitudes
of the planet and powerless point should not be more than
one hundred and eighty degrees. In case the difference
exceeds one hundred and eighty degrees deduct the
longitudes of t

he planet from powerless point.

CALCULATION OF DIGBALA OF THE PLANETS
OF THE STANDARD HOROSCOPE :-
The Bhava Madhya of the four Kendra Bhavas are as
follows (in decimals) :-

I 86.43 IV 166.15
VII 266.43 X 346.15

Let us see for Sun 166.15- 146.37 = 19.78
(as the difference from longitude of Sun- powerless point
is more than one hundred and eighty degrees the deduction
has been done from Powerless point.)
For Moon 346.15 - 309.50 36.65 and
For Saturn 166.43 - 86.43 = 80
(here we have subtracted the longitudes of powerless point
from that of Saturn as it is less than one hundred and eighty
degrees.)
Plt-iase therefore ensure that the difference between
the longitudes of the planet and that of powerless point is
always less than one hundred and eighty degrees.
