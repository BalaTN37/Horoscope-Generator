get fifteen Shashtiamsa, if in even Rashfin Navamsha chart
they get another fifteen shashtiamsa. If they are in even Rashi
in both Rashi and Navamsha they will get 15 + 15 = 30
shahstiamsa if in even Rashi in one and in odd in other they
will get 0 +15 = 15 or 15 + 0 = 15 shashtiamsa. If in odd


Rashi in both the charts the strength is equal to 0.

shashtiamsas each for occupying odd Rashis in Rashi chart
and Navamsha chart.
