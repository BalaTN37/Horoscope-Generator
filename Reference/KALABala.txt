KALA BALA - TEMPORAL
STRENGTH
The temporal strength is the strength of planets due to time
and it is found out by considering the year, month, day of
the week, Hora of the day etc. at the time of birth of the
native.
It consists of the following Nine Balas :-
(a) Nathonnath BaJa (b) Paksha BaJa
(c) Tribhaga Bala (d) Abda BaJa
(e) Masa BaJa (f) Vara BaJa
(g) Hora BaJa (h) Ayana BaJa
(i) Yuddha BaJa
(a) Nathonnath Bala :
Certain planets are strong at mid-night and powerless
at mid-day while certain others are powerless at mid-night
and powerful at mid-day. This strength is known as
Nathonnath Bala or Divaratri Bala and measured after
taking into account whether the native's birth took place
during day-time or night-time. Sun, Jupiter and Venus are
powerful at mid-day and powerless at mid-night. While
Moon, Mars and Saturn are powerful at mid-night and
powerless at mid-day. Mercury is considered as powerful
always whether it may be day or night.
HOW TO CALCULATE THE STRENGTH :
The method is as under :-
Mid-night means local mid-night ·and by mid-day
represents local mid-day.
Sun, Jupiter and Venus will get sixty Shashtiamsha at
local Twelve Noon. Their strength goes on decreasing till,
at local mid-night, reduced to .zero. In the case of Moon,
Mars and Saturn it is reversed i.e. they will have sixty
shashtiamsa at Local mid-night and zero at local mid-noon.
For finding out mid-day = Add half the din-man
(duration of day) in the time of sunrise. In the case of
standard horoscope sunrise is 6h 5m (1ST) and sunset is
18h 28m(IST)

Din -man= 18h 29m- 6h 5m = 12h 24m
•Half of Din-man = 12h 24m divideby 2 = 6h 12m.
Mid-day= 6h 5m + 6h 12m = 12h 17m (1ST)
Mid-night = I2h 17m + 12h = 24h 17m = 0h 17m (1ST)

Step I - Find out the difference of time of birth of the
native and that of local mid-night and convert into minutes
(it should not exceed 12 hours or 720 minutes) for example:
(a) If the time ofbirth is 5-30 AM (1ST) and local midnight
is 0-15 (1ST) the difference is 5b30m- Ohl5'"
= 5h15m= 315m.
b) If the time ofbirth is 2-30 PM (1ST) and local time
mid-night is 0-15 (1ST) or 24-15 (IST) difference
is 24h15'"-14h30'"= 91'45'"= 585'"as 2-30 PM is
14b30m.

Step II- As the maximum strength is sixty shashtiamsa
gained I lost in 12X60 =720m so for finding out the strength
of the planets strong at mid-day divide the difference by
seven hundred and twenty and multiplying by sixty i.e.
dividing by twelve we get the strength of Sun, Jupiter and
Venus.

i.e. in this example for case (a)
315 x 60 + 720 = 315 + 12 = 26.25 shashtiamsas
For case (b)
585 x 60 + 720 = 585 + 12 = 48.75 shashtiamsas

for the planets strong at mid-night i.e. Moon , Mars and
Saturn deduct above results from sixty.
t.e. for case (a)
60.00- 26.25 = 33.75 shashtiamsas
for case (b)
60.00- 48.75 = 11.25 shatiamsas

Now we apply it to the standard horos·cope for
calculating the nathonnatha Bala. The birth time is I hour
30 minutes = 90 minutes.
The difference oftime of birth and the local mid-night
= 90m -17m= 73'"
Nathonnath Bala of Sun, Jupiter and Venus
= 73 + 12 = 6 .I shashtiamsas.
Nathonnath Bala-.o( Moon, Mars and Saturn
.= 60- 6.1 = 53.9 shashtiamsas
Mercury is always powerful hence its Nathonnath Bala
= 60 shashtiamsas.
Though different methods are given at different places,
the method explained above is the simplest in modern
context. Therefore other methods for calculating the

Nathonnah BaJa have not been given to avoid confusion.

(b) Paksha BaJa :
This is the strength of the planets gained by the
Paksha/fortnight in which the native was born. Ashubh
(Malefic) planets are strong in Krishna Paksha i.e. dark
halfwhen the Moon is waning. The shubha planets arc
strong in Shukla Paksha i.e. when the Moon is waxing. Sun,
Mars, Saturn and afflicted Mercury are Ashubhas (Malefics
or Papas) while Jupiter, Venus and well associated Mercury
are shubhas (Benefics). Moon is benefic from eighth day
of bright half (shukla Paksha) to 8th day of dark half
(Krishna Paksha).

For calculation of P AKSHA BALA
Find out the difference of longitudes of Moon and
Sun. It should not be more than one hundred and eighty
degrees, the formula becomes
(Moon's longitude- Sun's longitude) x 60 divide by 180
=(Moon's longitude- Sun's Longitude) divide by 3
if the numerator is more than one hundred and eighty reverse
the Moon and Sun i.e. (Sun's longitude-Moon's Longitude)
divided by three will give the shashtiamsas of shubhas
(Benefics). The Paksha Bala of Ashubhas (Malefics) will
be obtained by deducting the Paksha Bala of Bcnefics from
sixty. Moon's Paksha Bala will always be doubled.

For the standard horoscope :-
(Moon's longitude.:... Sun's longitude)divide by 3
(as the numerator is less than 180°)
= (309.50- 146.37) divide by 3 = 163.13 divide by 3 = 54.38
Ben.efics i.e. Venus and Jupiter.
Paksha BaJa = 54.38 Shashtiamsa each.
Paksha Bala of Moon= 54.38 x 2 = 108.76 shashtiamsas

As Mercury is associated with Jupiter and Saturn but
nearer to Jupiter it will be taken as benefic. Its Paksha Bala
is 54.38.
PakshaBala of Mars, Sun and Saturn
= 60- 54.38 = 5.62 shashtiamsas each.

By the above it is concluded that the students should
not confuse.themselves with the Paksha. When the Moon
is increasing the Balas of Benefics and the Moon are
increasing and of Malefics decreasing.
When the Moon is decreasing the balas ofbenefics
and Moon are decreasing and malefics increasing. The
Paksha Bala depends on the longitudes of the Moon and
the Sun.


(c) Tribhag Bala :
It is the strength obtained by the planets due to that
part of day/ night in which the native was born.
The day and night arc divided into three equal parts
and for every part one planet gets sixty shashtiarnsas while
Jupiter always gets sixty shahtiamsas and the rest get zero.
The chart showing the planets to get sixty shashtiamsas is

[
  {
    "Part": "1st Part",
    "Day": "Mercury",
    "Night": "Moon"
  },
  {
    "Part": "2nd Part",
    "Day": "Sun",
    "Night": "Venus"
  },
  {
    "Part": "3rd Part",
    "Day": "Saturn",
    "Night": "Mars"
  }
]


Jupiter always gets sixty shatiamsas.
Method for calculation of Tribhaga BaJa :-
Find the time of Sun rise and sunset at the place of
birth. Deducting Sunrise time from Sunset time (in Railway
time) we get the duration of day. Dividing this by three we
will get the length of each part of the day. By adding one
p'art with Sun rise time the ending time oflst part is arrived
at, which will be the beginning time of the II part. By adding
the duration of time of a part to it we will get the ending
time of II part which is also the starting time of III part
and it will end at Sun set.
Find out the Ratriman i.e. duration of night= Twenty
four - duration of the day (Dinaman) and dividing it by
three we will get the duration of each part for night. As
we have found out for the day we shall find the I, II and
Ill parts of night by substituting Sunset for Sunrise and
Sunrise for Sunset in the above.

Now the Tribhaga Bala of the standard horoscope is
calculated :-

Sunrise =
Sunset =
6-05 AM
6-29 PM = 18-29 PM
Duration of day = J8h29m - 6h05'" = I 2h24m
Duration of night = 24h - 12h24'" = 1 Jl'36'"
As the. birth time is 1-30 AM i.e. night we are to find
the Part of night.
29
So II h36m + 3 = 3h-52m is the duration of each part .
of 'Ratriman'
1st Part of night starts from time of Sunset I Sh29m and
adding one part i.e. 3h52mwe observe I part ends at 22hlJm.
lind Part of night starts from 22h2J m and extends upto
(22h2J m+ 3h52m;., 26h 13m) 2h I 3m (early morning of the next
day) . '
III Part of night starts from 26hJ3m (or 2h13m AM) to 6h
sm (time of Sunrise of next day)
Therefore the native was born in II part of night. So Venus
will get sixty shashtiamsas.
STRENGTH:
Venus and Jupiter would get sixty shashtiamsas each
as tribhaga BaJa and the rest will get zero.
(d) Abda BaJa :
For Astrological purposes only the Indians considered
a year of three hundred and sixty days and a month of thirty
days. These years and months are neither related to
movement of Sun nor that of Moon. They are not related
, to luni-solar year also.
The Abdadhipati i.e. lord of the first day of such
an year of the birth ofNative will get fifteen shashtiamsa
as Abda Bala and rest will get zero.
'Ahargana' is the number of days passed upto any
particular epoch. The number of days elapsed since the
creation are known as Srishtyadi Ahargana.
To count Srishtyadi ahargana upto a particular day
is difficult.
On the basis of the table I grven in the book Graha
and Bhava Balas by Dr. B.V. Raman another table of

Ahargana has been prepared in which the table starts from
1951 instead of 1827.
On the basis of this new table which is given as Table
-1 (page 65) the ahargana for the date of birth of the
standard horoscope is as under :-
Ahargana on 31-12-1980 = 10767
No. of days passed from = 243
1-1-81 to (as per table II)
No. of days passed in Sept. 1981 = 13

11023

Dividing it by three hundred and sixty we get a quotient
of thirty and remainder as two hundred and twenty three.
.. No. of years completed is thirty and every year
number of days more than complete week = 360 divideby 7 = 3
(which is the remainder). So in thirty completed years we
will have number of days more than completed weeks will
be 30 x 3 = 90.

The first day of next year will be 90 +I= 91 days.
Dividing it by seven we get 91 + 7 = 13 & remainder nil.
The frrst day of the year in which the birth took place
was therefore Tuesday and lord is Mars.{Tableiii)
So Mars will have Abda BaJa = 15 Shashtiamsa and
other planets will get 0.

(e) Masa Bala :
In a Month ofthirty days, Number of days more than
complete weeks are two (thirty divided by seven and
remainder is two).
To find out the day on the 1st day of the month in
which the native was born the calculations are :-

No. of days passed up to the date of birth = 11 023
(as calculated in Abdabala)
11023 ..,_ 30 = 367 13
/ 30
No. of days more than complete weeks in 367 months
= 367 X 2 = 734
N·o. of days more than complete weeks on the 1st day of
month in which the native was born = 734 + 1 = 735
Now 735 + 7 = 105 & remainder zero.
So 1st day of the month of birth was Tuesday and
its lord is Mars. Therefore, Mars gets thirty shatiarnsas as
Masa BaJa and the rest of the planets get zero.

(f) Vara BaJa :
The number of days including 12th Sept. 1981 =
11022
NOTE: The time ofbirth of the native is 1-30 AM of
13-9-1981. The Gregorian Calender date starts from midnight
while the Indian day starts from sunrise and ends on
the next Sun rise. Therefore, the date according to Indian
system was 12-9-81 and not 13-9-81. So we have incl_uded
. ihe 12th only not the 13th in the above data.
Now calculation ofVara on the day ofbirth = 11022
+ 7 = 1574 4
/
7 i.e. four is the remainder after completion
of I 574 weeks. Now count zero = Tuesday, One =
Wednesday, Two = Thursday, Three = friday, Four =
Saturday. Therefore, the day was Saturday and its lord was
Saturn which will get fortyfive shashtiamsas and rest zero
as Vara Bala. ·

(g) Hora BaJa :
Hora is of One hour and starts from the Sunrise. In
the present case Sunrise is 6-5 am IST and the time of
birth is 1-30 am i.e. 25-30 1ST.

As the day of birth is Saturday. The lors of 1st Hora will
be Saturn, that of II will be Jupiter and so on.

So the lord of twentieth Hora is Mercury and it will
get sixty shashtiamsas as Hora Bala and other planets will
get zero.

(h) Ayana BaJa :
The strength of a planet being in the North or South
of the Celestial'Equator is known as Ayana Bala.
Ayana Bala depends upon d,eclination (Kranti) of a
planet. The declination is the ang'ular distance of a planet
from it to the foot of the perpendicular on celestial equator.
If the planet is in the north of Equator the declination
is North and word 'N' or (+) sign is written after the
degrees of declination. If it is towards south the word 'S'
or (-) sign is shown after the degrees of declination.
Sun crosses the equator twice every year. Once going
towards North from South and this point is known as
Vernal equinox or spring equinox and second time going
to South from North and this point is named 'Autumnal
Equinox'. At these two Equinoctical points (spring equinox
and Autumnal equinox) the declination of Sun is zero as it
is on the equator and its distance from equator is zero.
The declination is one of the pair (declination, Right
ascension) which shows the position of a heavenly body
with respect to vernal equinox and equator.
The declination is always measured in respect of a
Sayana Graha. Therefore, the sayana longitudes of
a planets are to be determined by adding ayanamsa
to the nirayana longitudes.
The maximum declination of Sun is 24°(23°27') which
is the inclination of ecliptic with the equator. For Ayana
Bala we will take the maximum declination as 24° towards
North and 24° towards south i.e. the total movement in
declination will be 24 + 24 = 48°.
Determination of declination from Nirayana
Longitudes:
(I) Convert the N irayana longitudes of all the planets
34
into Sayana longitj.ldes.
(2) Find out their distance from the nearest equinoctical
vernal equinox !Uld Autumnal Equinox have 0° and 180"
Sayana longitudes. This: distance will be called
'Bh.uja'.
1. From o• to 90" Bhuja will be
2. From 90• to 180" Bhuja will be
longitude - o·
1800- longitude
longitude - 180°
360° - longitude
3. From 180" to 270" Bhuja will be
4. ·From 270° to 360° Bhuja will be
When Bhuja is Declination is
o· 0
1 5• 362'
30• 362' + 341' = 703'
45° 703' + 299' = 1002'
60• 1002' + 236' = 1238'
75• 1238' + 150' = 1388'
90• 1388' +52'= 1440'
For intermediate longitudes fmd the Declination by the
rule of three. Let the degrees of planet be 215" as it is in
between 180" and.270" so Bhuja is 215 - 180 = 35"
Declination for 35• of Bhuja for {30"+5"(proportion of
increase from 30• to 45")}.
= 703' + 299 X 5 +15
= 703' + 100' = 803' nearly.
Calculation of Ayana BaJa :
For Sun, Venus, Mars and Jupiter the North
declination should be added to twenty four and Southern
35
declination should be deducted from twenty four i.e. their
declination should be counted from the extreme southern
end. It can also be implied that they get maximum Ayanabala,
when they are at Northern end of their path afterwards they
start moving down. Sun's Ayanabala is always doubled.
For Saturn and Moon the southern declination is added
to· twenty four and Northern declineation deducted from
twentyfour which means that they get the maximum
Ayanabala while at the southern. end of their path and zero
when at the Northern end.
For Mercury the declination whether Southern or
Northern is always additive to twentyfour i.e. Mercury is
strong in Ayanabala when at the southern/Northern ends
and weak at the equator.
The maximum Ayanabala is sixty shashtiamsas and the
declination from Southern end to Northern end is 24 + 24
= 48".
·Jn 48" Ayanabala is raised from zero to sixty
sashtiamsa so in x· the Ayanabala will be X X 60 + 48
i.e. the formula becomes
Ayanabala = (24 ± declination) x 60/48
the ± for addition or subtraction of declination as per
. rules given above.

The calculation of Ayanabala for standard horoscope
is given in the following chart.
Ayanamsa = 23° 35' 50" = 23.60

(h) Yuddhabala :
Two planets are said to be at war when the difference
between their longitudes is less than one degree. The planet
with lesser longitude wins in this war and gains some
strength while the strength of the loser is deducted by the
same amount.
Sun and Moon are two luminaries and as such any
planet in conjunction or within one degree of these two is
not at war with them.
Calculation for Yuddhabala
The balas (in shashtiamsas) upto in Kalabala
are calculated for both the planets at war i.e. Positional
strength + directional strength + temporal strength upto
Horabala (Temporal strength except Ayanabala and
Yuddhabala which is now being found out).
It is to be divided by the difference of the diameters
of the discs (in seconds) of the fighting planets.

The Yuddhabala of the standard horoscope.
In this horoscope Mercury and Jupiter are at war as
their longitudes are respectively 170°.53 and 170°.45. The
longitude of Jupiter is lesser and hence Jupiter wins.

Difference= 444.51-305.45 = 139.06 (shashtiamsa)
Difference in diameter of disc= 190.4-6.6 = 183".8
Yuddhabala = 139.06 + 183.8 = 0.8 (shashtiamsa)
Now Mercury's yuddhab.ala is - 0.80 (negative)
Jupiter's yuddhabala is + 0.80 (positive)
