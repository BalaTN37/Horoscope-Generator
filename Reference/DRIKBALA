ASPECT STRENGTH OR DRIK BALA

Aspectual strength is the strength of Planets gained due
to aspect of other planets on it.
Drishti or Aspect :
The aspected planet is always taken ahead and
aspecting one behind i.e. for calculation of Drishti Kendra
or Aspect angle the longitudes of aspecting planets are
subtracted from the aspected planets.
Normally the planets aspect the other planets most
powerfully at the position 180 degree away from it. But
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (outer planet) have special aspect
or vishesha Drishti i.e. Mars aspects the fourth and eighth
house with full Drishti while Saturn aspects the third and
tenth house with full Drishti and Jupiter aspects the fifth
and ninth house from it with full Drishti.
Drishti Kendra or Aspect Angle:
Drishti Kendra or Aspect Angle is obtained by
subtracting the longitudes of Aspecting planet from the
Aspected planet.

Table of Aspect Angle
Drishti Kendra or Aspect Angle =
Longitude of Aspected planet- Longitude of Aspecting planet.

Drishti Value :
The Drishti Values are calculated by any of the two
methods as given on next page. One is in the shape of
formulae and the other deducable from the figure.

Method I:
When Aspect Drishti Value
angle is is
(a) 0 - 30 degree = Nil
(b) 30·- 60 degree = (D K- 30)/2
(c) 60 - 90 degree = (D K- 60) + 15
(d) 90 - 120 degree = (120- D K)/2 + 30
(e) 120- 150 degree = 150- D K
(I) 150 - 180 degree = (D K- 150) X 2
(g) 180 - 300 degree = (300- D K)/2


Here points have been used for shashtiamsas.
(1) From aspect angle 300° to 30° the Aspect value
or Drishti value is zero.
(2) It increases from 0 to 15 points in 30° i.e. from
30° to 60°. So there is an increase of 1 point for
every 2°.
(3) Increase from 15 points to 45 points is from 60°
to 90° the increase is of 30 points in 30°. In other
words for every degree the increase is I point.
(4) From 90° to 120° there is a decrease of 15 points
(decrease of 15 points in ,30°) i.e. for every two
degrees there is a decrease of I point.
(5) From 120° to 150° (in 30°) there is decereasc
of30 points (30pts. to Opt.). So for every degree,
the decrease is of 1 point.
(6) From 150° to 180° (in 30°), the increase is zero
pt. to 60pts. (60 points), so for every degree, the
increase of 2 points.
(7) From 180° to 300° (in 120°) the decrease is from
60 pcints to 0 points (60 points) i.e. for every
two degrees the decrease is of one point.
By using the figure (II method) we can calculate the
aspect value very easily. Before proceeding to actual
calculations, the special aspect may be considered fir.st.
(a) The special aspect of Mars arc of IV house and VIII
house i.e. when the aspect angle from Mars is 90°
to 120° and 210° to 240° and value of this special
Drishti is 15 Shasht iamsas or points. The reason for
these 15 points has not been given anywhere (to my
knowledge). But it is not without rule and in my view
the rule is the IV house starts from 90° and VIII starts
from 210° the aspect value is 45 shashtiamsas at
these aspect angles. To make it a full drishti an
addition of 60 - 45 15 shashtiamsas is to be done.
(b) The special aspect ofjupitcr is on V and IX houses.
When it is 120° to 150° or 240° to 270° behind the
aspcctcd body and it is full = 60 shasht iamsas. The
aspect value at 120° and 240° behind is 30 pts and
to make it a full Drishti add 60 - 30 = 30 points
. (shashtiamsas).
(c) The special aspect of saturn is on Illrd and Xth
houses i.e. from 60° to 90° and 270° to· 300° of
aspect angle. The aspect value at 60° and 270° of
aspect angle is 15 points. To get full Drishti value an
addition of 60 - 15 = 45 points/shashtiamsas is to
be done.


So the addition for special aspects are summarized as
follows:-
Aspect angle Add in
shashtiamsas
(i) Mars 90° to 120J 15
210° to 240°
(ii) Jupiter 120°to 150J
30
240° to 270°
(iii) Saturn 60° to 90J 45
270° to 300°

Subha grahas will have benefic Drishti to be denoted 1
by ( +) sign and Ashubhas will have Malefic Drishti to be
shown as (-) sign.
The Jupiter, Venus, Waxing Moon (7th to 8th) and
well are shubhas while Sun, Mars,
Saturn, Waning Moon (8 of Krishna Paksha to 7th of Shukla
Paksha) and badly associated Mercury are Ashubhas.
Drishti Pinda :
The total Aspect value of all the planets considering
positive for shubhas and negative for Ashubhas, the Drishti
Pinda will be arrived at.

Drik BaJa :
Drik bala is one fourth of the Drishti Pinda.

REMEMBER : I Rupaa = 60 Shashtiamsas

As the number of Rupas for moderate strength differ
the strength of a planet is to be divided by the minimum
required strength. If it is more than l the planet is strong.
lfless than 1, it is weak. The strength of different planets
can be compared by this also :-


Gradation of the strength of the Planets :
The planets require certain minimum strength in rupas
to acquire average strength i.e. they are moderate (neither
strong nor weak). If their strength is more than that, they
arc strong. If their strength is less than the specified, they
arc weak.
That required stn:ngth is:
(i) Sun 5 Rupas
(ii) Moon 6 Rupas
(iii) Mars 5 Rupas
(iv) Mercury 7 Rupas
(v) Jupiter 6.5 Rupas
(vi) Venus 5.5 Rupas
(vii) Saturn 5 Rupas.

As the number of Rupas for moderate strength differ
the strength of a planet is to be divided by the minimum
required strength. If it is more than l the planet is strong.
lfless than 1, it is weak. The strength of different planets
can be compared by this also :-

descending order of strength.
